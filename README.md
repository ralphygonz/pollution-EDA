# Air Quality and Pollution Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains my comprehensive analysis of air quality and pollution data using a Kaggle dataset. The project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data while uncovering critical insights about pollution trends, geographical distribution, and factors influencing air quality. This project highlights my proficiency with SQL, Excel, and Python for data analysis workflows.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **SQL**: Utilized MySQL Workbench for advanced querying, including data extraction, filtering, grouping, and joining tables to uncover patterns in pollution metrics.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to reveal trends, outliers, and correlations between pollutants and air quality index (AQI).
- **Excel**: Designed an interactive visualization dashboard to showcase key insights, enabling a deeper understanding of pollution dynamics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed raw data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats for accurate analysis.
- **Visualization**: Created clear and impactful charts to present findings, including trends, comparisons, and regression analysis.
